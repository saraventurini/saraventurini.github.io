Thank you Francesco Rinaldi, Andrea Cristofari and Damiano Zeffiro for the invitation to give a talk in the Derivative-free optimization stream at the [20th EUROPT Workshop on Advances in Continuous Optimization](http://www.europt.hu/)!<br/>

I will present the work:<br/> 
Learning the right layers: a zeroth-order bi-level optimization strategy for semi-supervised learning on multilayer graphs.<br/>
Sara Venturini, Andrea Cristofari, Francesco Rinaldi, and Francesco Tudisco <br/>

Look forward to have comments from the optimization community on our work!
