I partecipated in the collabathonon Rewired Networks, in Portland, Maine. 
This was a 3-days collaboration with early reserachers, with the aim of analyze, implement and compare techniques to rewire networks. The result will be a python library (https://github.com/netsiphd/netrw).
Too many amazing experiences and too many wonderful people in these months!
