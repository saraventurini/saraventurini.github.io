I just arrived at Indiana University in Bloomington! I will stay here till July.<br/>
I am a fellow of the [AccelNet-Multinet](https://www.accelnet-multinet.org/) exchange program, and I will collaborate with Prof. [Santo Fortunato](https://www.santofortunato.net/) (Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) on a project concerning multilayer networks to study the Science of Science.<br/>
I am so excited to start this adventure!<br/>
