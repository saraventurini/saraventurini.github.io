I am too enthusiastic that our work<br/> 
Learning the right layers: a data-driven layer-aggregation strategy for semi-supervised learning on multilayer graphs<br/> 
Sara Venturini, Andrea Cristofari, Francesco Rinaldi and Francesco Tudisco<br/>  
has been accepted at [ICML](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023), one of the leading international academic conferences in machine learning! <br/>

Quite a busy and happy research period!<br/>
