I can't believe that our work: <br/> 
Social Contagion in Science.<br/>
Sara Venturini, Satyaki Sikdar, Francesco Rinaldi, Francesco Tudisco, and Santo Fortunato<br/>
has been selected as planery talk at [IC2S2](https://www.ic2s2.org/) (16 over 918 submissions)!<br/>

I know the value of our research on my own but being appreciated and having the opportunity to present it to a large audience is always a pleasure!<br/>
Thanks a lot to my collaborators!<br/>

In addiction another work has been accepted as a parallel talk!<br/> 
The COVID-19 research outbreak: how the pandemic culminated in a surge of new researchers.<br/>
Sara Venturini, Satyaki Sikdar, Marie-Laure Charpignon, Sagar Kumar, Francesco Rinaldi, Francesco Tudisco, Santo Fortunato, Maiamuna S. Majumder <br/>
