I am thrilled to announce that I’ll be a PostDoc researcher at [MIT Senseable City Lab]( https://senseable.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, mentored by [Carlo Ratti]( https://carloratti.com/) and [Paolo Santi]( http://webhost.services.iit.cnr.it/staff/paolo.santi/)! <br/>

It hasn’t been an easy choice, because I really want to collaborate with many researchers in many different applications of complex networks! Thank you to all my collaborators who have made me grow and given me these wonderful opportunities. <br/>

 The increasing availability of digital data of this century offers unprecedented opportunities to model and analyse social systems and interactions. The Senseable City Lab would give me the opportunity to use my experiences and capacities to study human behavior in cities all over the world, and not just for the sake of knowledge, but with the aim of improving urban life. <br/>

I am sure that I will take the best from the top universities and researchers in the Boston area!
