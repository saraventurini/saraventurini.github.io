Mixed feelings, returning to Italy after 6 months in America. 
This has been really an amazing experience! I can never thank enough the AccelNet-MultiNet program, Santo Fortunato, Satyaki Sikdar, and my supervisors Francesco Rinaldi and Francesco Tudisco.
I have learned so much both in the personal and professional parts. It sounds like a clich√©, but it changed me. 
I will never forget all the people and friends of the department. 
I am going back home. But do we have just one?
