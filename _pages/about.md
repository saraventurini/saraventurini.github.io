I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mentored by [Carlo Ratti](https://carloratti.com/) and [Paolo Santi](http://webhost.services.iit.cnr.it/staff/paolo.santi/).<br/>

I earned a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics in 2023 from the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/) Italy, under the supervision of Prof. [Francesco Rinaldi](https://www.math.unipd.it/~rinaldi/) (University of Padova) and Prof. [Francesco Tudisco](https://ftudisco.gitlab.io/post/) (The University of Edinburgh, Gran Sasso Science Institute).<br/> 

I enjoy working on the computational analysis of complex networks and their application to the real world. Therefore, I aim to leverage data to model and analyze social systems as well as interactions.<br/> 
My research interests include: complex networks, optimization methods, machine learning, and the science of science.<br/>  

In 2022 I won a fellowship within the [AccelNet-Multinet](https://www.accelnet-multinet.org/) exchange program, which allowed me to visit [Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI)](https://iuni.iu.edu/) in Bloomington for 6 months to work with Prof. [Santo Fortunato](https://www.santofortunato.net/) and Dr. [Satyaki Sikdar](https://satyakisikdar.github.io/).<br/>

I started my academic career with a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Mathematics at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/) Italy.<br/>
