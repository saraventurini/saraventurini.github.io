I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the [MOBS Lab](https://www.mobs-lab.org/) within the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), mentored by [Alessandro Vespignani](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/alessandro-vespignani/).<br/> 

Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/) in 2024, mentored by [Carlo Ratti](https://carloratti.com/) and [Paolo Santi](http://webhost.services.iit.cnr.it/staff/paolo.santi/).<br/>

I completed my Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics in 2023 at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/) in Italy, 
under the supervision of Prof. [Francesco Rinaldi](https://www.math.unipd.it/~rinaldi/) (University of Padova) and Prof. [Francesco Tudisco](https://ftudisco.gitlab.io/post/) (The University of Edinburgh, Gran Sasso Science Institute), where I also obtained a Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics.<br/>

In 2022, I received a fellowship within the  [AccelNet-Multinet](https://www.accelnet-multinet.org/) exchange program, which allowed me to visit [Indiana University](https://iuni.iu.edu/) in Bloomington for 6 months to work with Prof. [Santo Fortunato](https://www.santofortunato.net/)<br/>

I enjoy working on the computational analysis of complex networks and their real-world applications. My research  interests include complex networks, optimization methods, machine learning, and the science of science.<br/>
