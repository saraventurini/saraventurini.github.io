abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic shifted academic collaboration from in-person to remote interactions. This study explores, for the first time, the effects on scientific collaborations and impact of such a shift, comparing research output before, during, and after the pandemic. Using large-scale bibliometric data, we track the evolution of collaboration networks and the resulting impact of research over time. Our findings are twofold: first, the geographic distribution of collaborations significantly shifted, with a notable increase in cross-border partnerships after 2020, indicating a reduction in the constraints of geographic proximity. Second, despite the expansion of collaboration networks, there was a concerning decline in citation impact, suggesting that the absence of spontaneous in-person interactions—which traditionally foster deep discussions and idea exchange—negatively affected research quality. As hybrid work models in academia gain traction, this study highlights the need for universities and research organizations to carefully consider the balance between remote and in-person engagement.
